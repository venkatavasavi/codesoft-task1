            <p>This project has helped individuals understand the benefits and impact of good health with good food.
             I designed  a website on food habits and health issues to create more awareness on more people.Through this project we have explored the impact of the unhealthy eating patterns,such as excessive consumption of the processed foods,high sugar intake and lack of fruits and vegetables,on the development of diseases like the diabetics,obesity,cardiovascularproblems and certain type of cancers.By providing evidence based information and practical tips, our website and project empowers individuals to make choices of their food habits and lead healthier lives.The main aim of the project is to prioritize their health and make positive changes in their dietary habits.  </p>
